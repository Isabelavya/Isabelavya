🌟 Hello, Lovely Wanderer! 🌟

I’m @Isabela, a dream-weaver and code whisperer. 🌙✨

- Passion: I dance with pixels, coaxing them into interactive projects that twinkle like constellations.
- Learning Journey: Currently sipping from the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript potion cauldron. 🧪🌿
- Collaboration Quest: Seeking fellow magic-makers to brew spells together! 🪄🌟
- Pronouns: Call me “her” or “she”—whichever sparkles in your heart. 💖🫦
- Fun Fact: I’m a nocturnal sprite; mornings are my secret bedtime stories. 🌄📚


💌 Reach out: Send a carrier pigeon or simply click the virtual doorbell. Let’s create enchantment! 🚪🔮

May your code be whimsical and your dreams be pixelated! 🌈🎨✨
